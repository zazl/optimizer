Dojo Zazl Javascript Optimizer
------------------------------

The Zazl Javascript Optimizer enables developers to produce optimized javascript environments for their Dojo syncloader and AMD based applications 
without having to depend on static build/optimizer tools.

Setting up a Development Environment
------------------------------------
1) Follow the development environment steps described in the README on https://github.com/zazl/serverutils.
2) Clone the Optimizer git repo (git clone https://github.com/zazl/optimizer.git) from within the "zazldev/workspace" directory.
3) Import the projects found in the "zazldev/workspace/optimizer" directory via "File->Import->General->Existing Projects into Workspace".
